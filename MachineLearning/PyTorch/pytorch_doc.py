PYTORCH DOCUMENTATION

    PyTorch is an optimized tensor library for deep learning using GPUs and CPUs.

    Features described in this documentation are classified by release status:

        Stable: These features will be maintained long-term and there should generally 
        be no major performance limitations or gaps in documentation. We also expect to 
        maintain backwards compatibility (although breaking changes can happen and notice 
        will be given one release ahead of time).

        Beta: Features are tagged as Beta because the API may change based on user feedback,
        because the performance needs to improve, or because coverage across operators is not
        yet complete. For Beta features, we are committing to seeing the feature through to 
        the Stable classification. We are not, however, committing to backwards compatibility.

        Prototype: These features are typically not available as part of binary distributions 
        like PyPI or Conda, except sometimes behind run-time flags, and are at an early stage 
        for feedback and testing.
